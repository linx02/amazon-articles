This technology ensures that users can feel every pulsing beat, making it perfect for those who appreciate deep bass and clear audio. The earbuds also come equipped with Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) technology, which utilizes two microphones to minimize background noise, allowing you to immerse yourself fully in your music or podcasts. Additionally, the Ambient Aware feature lets you stay aware of your surroundings, making these earbuds a safe choice for outdoor activities.\n\n# Comfort and Convenience\n\nDesigned with user comfort in mind, the JBL Tune Flex includes multiple ear tip sizes to ensure a secure fit for various ear shapes. This is particularly beneficial for active users who need earbuds that stay in place during workouts or while on the move. The earbuds are also water-resistant and sweatproof, rated at IPX4, which means they can withstand light rain and sweat, making them ideal for gym sessions or outdoor adventures.\n\nBattery life is another highlight, with up to 32 hours of playtime (8 hours in the earbuds and an additional 24 hours in the charging case).
